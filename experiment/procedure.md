### Procedure

The experiment consists of two tasks. The user is recommended to go through these in the same sequence as they are presented.

1. Identify All Check-Sums Generated by a Monomial
    * Given a monomial, select all the checksums corresponding to it
2. Majority Logic Decoder
    * Given a received noisy codeword, simulate majority logic decoding to estimate the coefficients of all monomials in a RM(2,4) code.
