      "question": "Let $f(X_1, X_2) = X_1X_2 + X_2$ be a Boolean polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}_2$. What is $f(1, 0)$?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Substituting $(X_1, X_2) = (1, 0)$ gives $f(1,0) = 1\\cdot0 + 0 = 0$",
        "b": "Incorrect. Substituting $(X_1, X_2) = (1, 0)$ gives $f(1,0) = 1\\cdot0 + 0 = 0$.",
        "c": "Incorrect. There is no 2 in $\\mathbb{F}_2$; computations are only modulo 2.",
        "d": "Incorrect. After substituting, the result must be a number (0 or 1), not a variable."

      "question": "Which of the following best explains why the generator matrix of $RM(1, m)$ has rank $m + 1$?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because there are $m$ linearly independent monomials of degree 1 and one constant term.",
        "b": "Because there are $2^m$ possible evaluation points.",
        "c": "Because each codeword is orthogonal to its complement.",
        "d": "Because $RM(1,m)$ is self-dual."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The basis consists of $1, X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_m$, which are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The number of evaluation points determines code length, not rank.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Orthogonality is relevant to the dual code, not to rank computation.",
        "d": "Incorrect. $RM(1,m)$ is not self-dual except in trivial cases."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Degree 2 monomials like $X_1X_2$ are included since the order is 2.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is also degree 2, so it belongs.",
        "c": "Correct. $X_1X_2X_3$ has degree 3, which exceeds 2 and hence is excluded.",

      "question": "If a codeword of $RM(2,4)$ is obtained by evaluating $f(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) = X_1X_2 + X_3X_4 + 1$, how many coordinates equal 1 in this codeword?",

        "a": "Incorrect. That’s too few. It is the minimum distance of the code, but not weight of this code.",

        "c": "$r = 3$",
        "d": "$r = 4$"
      },
      "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect. If $r=1$, the minimum distance would be $2^{5-1} = 16$.",
      "b": "Correct. The minimum distance of $RM(r, m)$ is $2^{m-r}$. We solve $2^{5-r} = 8 = 2^3$, which implies $5-r=3$, so $r=2$.",
      "c": "Incorrect. If $r=3$, the minimum distance would be $2^{5-3} = 4$.",
